# Coming Soon

## Current Known issues

1. Use `SITE_ID` instead of using the first site
2. `django-paypal` should be a git submodule, however the current setup is easier for non-technical users to setup and run
3. Fix the hackish mix of CSS and abuse of `style`
4. URL for Aviary integration should not be hardcoded
5. not fully PEP-8 compliant
